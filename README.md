# Arduino TimerInterrupt Library

This library enables you to use Interrupt from Hardware Timers on an Arduino, such as Nano, UNO, Mega, etc.

Why do we need this Hardware Timer Interrupt?

Imagine you have a system with a mission-critical function measuring water level and control the sump pump or more something much more important.
You'd like to have a software timer to poll, or even place the function in loop(). But somehow, another function is blocking the loop() or setup().
So your function might not be executed, and the result would be disastrous.

You'd prefer to have your function called no matter what happening with other functions (busy loop, bug, etc.).

The correct choice is to use a Hardware Timer with Interrupt to call your function.

These hardware timers, using interrupt, still works even if other functions is blocking. Moreover, they are much more precise (certainly depending on clock frequency accurary) than other software timers using millis() or micros(). That's necessary if you need to measure some data with better accuracy.

Functions using normal software timers, relying on loop() and calling millis(), won't work if the loop() or setup() is blocked by certain operation.

The catch is your function is now an ISR (Interrupt Service Routine), and must be lean and mean, and follow certain rules. More to read on

**Important Notes:**
1. Inside the attached function, delay() wonâ€™t work and the value returned by millis() will not increment. Serial data received while in the function may be lost. You should declare as volatile any variables that you modify within the attached function.

2. Typically global variables are used to pass data between an ISR and the main program. To make sure variables shared between an ISR and the main program are updated correctly, declare them as volatile.

## Installation
1. Navigate to (https://github.com/khoih-prog/TimerInterrupt/releases/tag/v1.0.0) page.
2. Download the latest release `TimerInterrupt-master.zip`.
3. Extract the zip file to `TimerInterrupt-master` directory 
4. Copy whole folder to Arduino libraries' directory such as `.Arduino/libraries/TimerInterrupt-master`.

## More useful Information

### From https://www.robotshop.com/community/forum/t/arduino-101-timers-and-interrupts/13072

1. Timer0:
Timer0 is a 8bit timer.
In the Arduino world timer0 is been used for the timer functions, like delay(), millis() and micros(). If you change Timer0 registers, this may influence the Arduino timer function. So you should know what you are doing.

2. Timer1:
Timer1 is a 16bit timer.
In the Arduino world the Servo library uses timer1 on Arduino Uno (Timer5 on Arduino Mega).

3. Timer2:
Timer2 is a 8bit timer like Timer0.
In the Arduino work the tone() function uses Timer2.

4. Timer3, Timer4, Timer5:
Timer 3,4,5 are only available on Arduino Mega boards. These timers are all 16bit timers.


## Supported Arduino Boards
- Arduino Uno / Mega / Leonardo / Duemilanove / Diecimila / LilyPad / Mini / Fio / Nano etc.
- Teensy 1.0 / 1.0++ / 2.0 / 2++ / 3.0 / 3.1 / Teensy-LC;
- Sanguino
- ATmega8, 48, 88, 168, 328
- ATmega8535, 16, 32, 164, 324, 644, 1284,
- ATmega64, 128

## Usage

Before using any Timer, you have to make sure the Timer has not been used by any other purpose.

Only Timer1 and Timer2 are supported for Nano, UNO, etc. boards possessing 3 timers.
Timer3, Timer4 and Timer5 are supported for Arduino Maga boards.

How to use:

```
#include "TimerInterrupt.h"

#define TIMER1_DURATION_MS  5000L
#define TIMER1_FREQUENCY    10
#define TIMER1_INTERVAL_MS  (1000 / TIMER1_FREQUENCY)

#define TIMER2_DURATION_MS  20000L
#define TIMER2_FREQUENCY    100
#define TIMER2_INTERVAL_MS  (1000 / TIMER2_FREQUENCY)

void TimerHandler1()
{
  // your readSensor() function will be called @ TIMER1_FREQUENCY = 10 Hz or every 100ms
  // This uses hardware timer interrupt and still works even if other functions is blocking.
  // Functions using normal software timers, relying on loop() and calling millis(), won't work
  // if the loop() or setup() is blocked by certain operation.
  readSensor();
}

void TimerHandler2()
{
  // your_Function() will be called @ TIMER2_FREQUENCY = 100Hz or every 10ms.
  your_Function();
}

void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(115200);
  
  ...
  
  // Timer0 is used for micros(), millis(), delay(), etc and can't be used
  // Select Timer 1-2 for UNO, 0-5 for MEGA
  // Timer 2 is 8-bit timer, only for higher frequency  
  ITimer1.init();
   
  // Using ATmega328 used in UNO => 16MHz CPU clock , 
  // For 16-bit timer 1, 3, 4 and 5, set frequency from 0.2385 to some KHz
  // For 8-bit timer 2 (prescaler up to 1024, set frequency from 61.5Hz to some KHz
  if (ITimer1.attachInterrupt(TIMER1_FREQUENCY, TimerHandler1))
    Serial.println("Starting  ITimer1 OK, millis() = " + String(millis()));
  else
    Serial.println("Can't set ITimer1. Select another freq. or timer");
    
  //Timer2
  ITimer2.init();
      
  if (ITimer2.attachInterruptInterval(TIMER2_INTERVAL_MS, TimerHandler2))
    Serial.println("Starting  ITimer2 OK, millis() = " + String(millis()));
  else
    Serial.println("Can't set ITimer2. Select another freq. or timer");    
}

void loop()
{
}

```
